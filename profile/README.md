## What is AI-CVM?
The AI in the CardioVascular Medicine Laboratory (AI-CVM) primarily focuses on AI research, specifically on state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) applications in cardiovascular disease.  The laboratory aims to address a wide range of health-related questions using multimodal information analysis. This spans diverse datasets, including text, signals, medical images from various modalities, videos, electronic health records (EHRs), and omics data.
